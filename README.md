The problem we propose to solve is to enhance marketing strategies by leveraging customer personality analysis. Traditional marketing approaches often rely on generic segmentation based on demographics or historical purchase behavior. However, this approach fails to capture the nuances of individual customer preferences and behaviors, limiting the effectiveness of marketing campaigns. By leveraging customer personality analysis, we aim to develop a machine learning algorithm model that will target specific customers and personalize the marketing approach.
